**Title:** Nexus between domestic violence against women and child malnutrition: findings from demographic and health survey

**Abstract**

**Background**

In Bangladesh, where a substantial number of women experience intimate partner violence (IPV), and child malnutrition is prevalent, this study explores the link between women's lifetime IPV exposure and the nutritional status of their pre-school children, addressing gaps in understanding the long-term consequences of IPV on child nutrition in the region.

**Methods**

This study utilized consolidated data from recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in low- and middle-income countries, focusing on ever-married women aged 15 to 49 and their children under five. Employing a two-stage stratified cluster sampling approach, the research assessed women's exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) and its association with child nutritional outcomes using descriptive statistics, Chi-Square tests, and a multiple logistic regression model, ensuring comprehensive exploration of socio-economic determinants in the context of IPV and child.

**Findings**

The study's descriptive statistics revealed a noteworthy malnutrition rate of 58.6% among one-year-old children, decreasing with age. In univariate analysis, significant associations were found with child's age (p = 0.0156), maternal education (p = 0.0022), wealth index (p = 0.01), mode of delivery (p = 0.0397), and recent fever (p = 0.0104). However, the final logistic regression highlighted the decisive influence of child age, with two-year-olds showing a substantially higher likelihood of malnutrition (OR = 3.79, 95% CI: 1.50-9.60, p < 0.01), while other factors like child sex, maternal education, wealth index, mode of delivery, and recent fever lacked statistical significance in predicting child malnutrition in this context.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, this study underscores the multifaceted nature of child malnutrition in Bangladesh, emphasizing the critical role of age, maternal education, and wealth status. The findings advocate for targeted interventions and nuanced approaches that consider the specific dynamics of domestic violence, socio-economic factors, and child nutrition in order to enhance the effectiveness of interventions and improve child health outcomes.
